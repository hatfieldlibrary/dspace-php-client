# dspace-php-client
PHP client for read-only DSpace API information.

The client provides functions for DSpace API queries to retrieve Community, Collection, Item and Bitstream information.

The client returns only "essential" information about DSpace objects. The goal is to provide a simple tool for 
constructing websites that incorporate information from the DSpace repository, omitting the more extensive 
information needed to create a fully-featured DSpace user interface.
